        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
            Chandrashekhar Azad was one of the greatest revolutionaries of India’s freedom struggle,
            remembered for his unmatched courage, fierce patriotism, and unwavering commitment to
            India’s independence. He was born on 23 July 1906 in Bhabhra village of present-day Madhya
            Pradesh. From a very young age, Azad was deeply influenced by the growing nationalist
            movement against British colonial rule.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1921, Azad was arrested by British authorities.
            When asked his name, he replied “Azad” (Free), named his father “Swatantrata” (Freedom),
            and gave his residence as “Jail.” This bold act earned him the name Chandrashekhar Azad
            and symbolized his lifelong vow to remain free from British captivity.
        </p>

        <p>
            After the suspension of the Non-Cooperation Movement, Azad joined the revolutionary
            organization Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which later became the Hindustan
            Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). He emerged as a key strategist and leader,
            working closely with revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru. Azad
            believed that armed resistance was necessary to awaken the masses against oppression.
        </p>

        <p>
            Azad played a significant role in several revolutionary activities, including the
            Kakori Train Action and the reorganization of HSRA after the execution of Bhagat Singh.
            He dedicated himself to training young revolutionaries, procuring arms, and spreading
            socialist ideas to ensure a just and equal India after independence.
        </p>

        <p>
            On 27 February 1931, surrounded by British forces at Alfred Park in Allahabad,
            Chandrashekhar Azad fought bravely until his last breath. True to his promise that
            he would never be captured alive, he used his final bullet on himself. His sacrifice
            made him an eternal symbol of resistance, bravery, and self-respect.
        </p>

        <p>
            Chandrashekhar Azad’s legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians. His life
            teaches us that freedom demands sacrifice, courage, and an unbreakable spirit.
            He remains immortal in the history of India as “Amar Shaheed” Chandrashekhar Azad.
